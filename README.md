This was the final project of the "Natural Language Processing" course taken up on the Spring 2025 semester at Iowa State University. 

The goal is to accurately classify whether or not a student is able to grasp the key concepts (termed as `IdeaUnit`) of a lecture. The training dataset (redacted) consists of IdeaUnits of multiple lectures divided into four segments. 

The repository comes attached with a report (`COMS_5790_NLP_FinalProject_Report.pdf`) which describes the various approaches taken up to solve the note classification problem using three different models : rule-based, BERT-based and LLM-based.
