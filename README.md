This was the final project of the "Natural Language Processing" course taken up on the Spring 2025 semester at Iowa State University. 

The repository comes attached with a report (`COMS_5790_NLP_FinalProject_Report.pdf`) which describes the various approaches taken up to solve the note classification problem using three different models : rule-based, BERT-based and LLM-based.
