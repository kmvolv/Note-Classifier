1,Physics,6416079,"Lasers - Invented during the very early 19th century - Einstein discovered two things: quantum theory of light and photons + stimulated emission.-> Two key factors of laser science - Maser: Microwaves and radiowaves, not visible. Can't actually see them. Invented in the 1950s by Charles Towne and Arthur Schawlow. - Laser: visible light. Invented by Gordon Gould, combined light and maser.   What are lasers? They are light beams. Vary in power. Today lasers are everywhere: optical disc players, laser printer, barcode printer, laser pointer, LASIK (laser based eye surgery). Our clothes are covered in lasers. Lasers are used when sending emails.  Lasers vs Flashlights Bathtub analogy: flashlights are ripples in bathtub, whereas lasers are HUGE waves on the sea. Flashlight makes a white light: mixture of coloured lights Lasers: Monochromatic light: only one colour of light. Lasers can shoot a narrow beam, flashlight shoot a shorter beam. Flashlight c  Laser is like a parade of soldiers. Flashlight is like a crowd of people. -> Photons  Characteristics of Lasers - Specificity - Distance - Consistency","How to make a laser: You need two basic parts: load of atoms that contain electrons (solid, liquid, or gas). The electrons are used for stimulation. Atoms are called the medium AND something to stimulate the medium with. Like a flash tube with a ruby crystal around it.  - You need a high voltage electric supply Original energy level: ground state When the photons are released from the electrons, they zoom up and down in the ruby crystal. Every once and a while, these photons willl stimulate an already excited atom. The atom will  Stimulated emission: One photon of light can produce two. Light has doubled in strength.   Lasers make electromagnetic radiation, not dangerous, and give off some photons. R in laser stands for radiation.    When we pump energy, this places some electrons into excited state. This short-term state is known as a meta-stable state. If we fire a photon with just the right energy, we can make some of the electrons jump down to the ground state. (Stimulated Emission). Stimulated emission is giving two photons out after putting one in. The two photons can stimulate other atoms to give off other atoms. This creates a chain reaction which ends up being a chain reaction. LASER = Light Ampliciation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation","What are the different types of laser lights?  Why do they make a single colour in a beam? Money analogy: smallest denomination is a penny. you can't have a tenth of a penny, but you can have 10 pennies. Each penny reps a quantum (quantity of energy).  You have to feed it a precise amoutn of energy to  Laser light is monochromatic.  Types of lasers: solid, liquid,   Solid-State Lasers:
Doping - introduc eimpurities into solid medium
High powered beams in short pulses.  Gas Lasers:
- CO2 lasers are one of the most powerful lasers in the world. Used in industrial applications like welding and cutting.
- Use gas (CO2 as medium) 
- Continuous beams, high-power, efficient Liquid lasers:
- Use solution of organic dye as medium.
- One advantage: can make lasers of many different colors (light frequencies) 
- Frequency of light determines its colours. Semiconductor Lasers:
- Cheap and tiny, used in CD players, and barcode scanners Fiber alsers:
- Used doped fiber optic as medium - Powerful, reliable, and efficient. - Can be as thin as a human hair. 
- Fiber optic internet cables are an example. They are coherent/consistent, they travel fast and can send signals without data loss. No electrical interference. - Charles Towne predicted laser beams could carry radio, television, hundred thousand telephone calls, range-finding, and missile-tracking.

1,Physics,6314506,"La  Masers discovered before Lasers. Masers invented by Charles Towne and Arthur Schawlow. Gordon Gould discovered lasers afterwards (he was a student of the two former scientists). A legal battle ensued over the patenting of the laser, and Gould eventually won.  Lasers are powerful light beams, and in their early discovery, practical applications were difficult to determine for the technology. Lasers emit a specific wavelength of light (monochromatic light), and can emit this light for long distances. For lasers, the light waves they emit are coherent, meaning they travel at the same frequency and wavelength in uniform.","Making a laser  Need a medium that contains electrons to be stimulated (like a ruby).

 Q about populations 
 pop = people that makes up interested group (entire collected objects)

 not always possible to obtain populaiton 
   Sample -- subset of pop 
 sampling for when you can't get entire population 
 N population n sample (smaller than pop) 
 ex 5000 pop and sample 50 
 
 Good sample --> look like pop (tricky to accomplish) 
 
 two types of stats - descriptive and inferential 
 descript = describes --> how well company pays the employees (highest, lowest, maximum, minimum, anything that describes the stats )
 infer = predicts --> tell us about data we don't have (10 weather stations - say stuff about places that don't have weather stations)","descriptive - graphing, describing, 
 tells you something bout sample 
 
 inferential tells you something about pop not sample 
 ex average wt of people in major compared to campus 
 collect data by random sampling - equally likely to be picked 
 
 experiement vs direct observation are the two ways to collect data 
 experiments --> know how to design them (research methods) 
 Direct obs ervation 3 types of observational studies 
 cross seciton - most common = m at given time and look at data (ht of men and women samples - shows the time of ht at time collected data) 
 Retrospective go back in time - ex: data already collected - not typically obtained by researcher 
 prospective - go forward in time 
 stop time - ba","observation - observe and don't affect action 
 key to it --> collect data as observe 
 can't show causation due to confoudning variables (hidden variable that may not be collected) can't collect all variables -- affect results 
 ex - more smoking more likely get cancer ---> smoking more likely to get cancer? is it bad heath habits? more firefighters more damage -- size of fire - need more firefighters when more fire. 
 always have to worry about confounding variables 
 
 experimental study 
 you affect the action   dealing with confounds - you control all other variables by randomization 

ex: 3 different sized bugs - random affected 



ronald fisher = fa","experiment - gold standard to answer Q 

not easy, money, unethical - lots of work - must know your question and if its doable 

can't do unethical experiments (unless it deals with animals - they do deliberate harm sometimes)

Convenience Sampling - sample based on ease 

Stratified sampling - split into different groups (men vs women - high school vs college) 

needs to have unbiased sample 

biased = favor 

must ask who the target populations are (like only sampling the mall  selection bias = selected ppl don't represent entire pop

 finite population stats - - - 
 good sample should look like the population
 descriptive vs inferential stats
 descriptive - summarizing
 inferential - inferring - more assumptions
 why are there videos on the side these are so distracting 
 example: descriptive stats tell you about a baseball game - data we know
 inferential example: data we don't necessarily have - weather station predictions/future predictions/
 ","descriptive - graphing, describing, characterizing
 example - average height for example - tell something about sample
 inferential - tell about population

 upper and lower bounds on things
 random sampling - equally likely to be picked 
 analysis relys on data
 collecting data - experiment vs direct observation
 experiments - clinical trials, psyc experiements - not enough time today????? 
 direct observation - very frequent - surveys are most common
 cross-sectional - retrospective - prospective
 cross sectional - measurement at given time - look at data - example - height in May 1990 male vs female
 retrospective - go back in time - what happened historically
 prospective - going forward in time - longitudin
  al dat longitudinal data - track data across time - forward
 ","observational studies - don't affect the action - collect data as you observe - could forget to collect variables which can cause problems 
 confounding variables - hidden variable driving things that was neglected to be observed/collected - never can really show causation - can't collect all variables (forgot to ask age, location, etc.) - affect results
 example of confounding variable - smoking leading to cancer - data in 80s based on observational studies that didn't consider smoking 
 example - more firefighter
 
   worry about confounding variables 

in experimental - you affect action - you cause what's going on 

cricket example - mating sick vs healthy

dealing with confounding variables - randomizatin

randomization - control over aspects like size, location, health, etc. 

ronald fisher - he existed i guess

","experiments vs observational studies 

experiments expensive, potentially unethical and difficult

don't deliberately cause harm in experiments

observational studies/surveys

convenience sampling - convienent to access

stratified- split population into different groups and randomly sample each (gender, age, etc)

still need unbiased groups

biased tends to favor one thing o ver anothe generalization - need unbied sample to represent and make predictions about population

selection bias - the selected subset doesn't represent the whole population

nonresponse bias - sample does not want to respond

response bias - not wording things in a neutral way ""what issue do you have with x"" vs ""are there any concerns""

 Population = an group of things - the entire collection of objects you're interested in
     Sometimes you cannot have an exact number for the population you seek
 
 
 
   Sample= subset of the population

 Experement - 
 Direct Observation - The two ways of collecting data

 2. Retrospective studies - Go back in time, what happened historically looking at existing data - Robert Fogel study
 3. Prospective studies - GOIN Prospective -  Prospective Study - going forward in time, the person who collects the data designed the study and track data across time.","Observational studies - don't affect the action, you look but do not touch
 Collect data as you observe - you cannot draw cause and effect
 
 Confounding variables - you might think that x causes y but z might contribute to y but you just missed it
 age, location, etc.
 ex: smoking=cancer but there was large controversies, what about other poor health habbits people who smoke have
 the more firefighters, the more fire damage you get, the size of the fire is the confounding variable
 The bigger a kid's feet the smarter the kid - the age = confounding variable
 
 Experimental studys - you affect the action
 
   Dealing with Confounds - you controlled all the other variables

randomization allows control - the duct tape of statistics

Ronald Fisher - foather ","People are not supposed to be harmed in a vacine study which makes it more ethical - sometimes it is hard to do experements in practice



Simple Random Sampling (SRS) - 

Convenience Sampling - sampled simply because they are convinient to be picked -roomate

Stratified sampling, Asking men a question, asking women a question - spliting them into groups



Unbiased vs biased sampling - sampling a football team on who they think will win the superbowl, knowing shopping habits of people you cannot only sample people who are in the mall in the middle  of the work week Selection bias - 2:00am your sample is biased to people who can be outside late at night and there is non-response bias. Many people will ignore you because it is so late

1,Statistics,6260321,"stats: a way of collecting and analyzing data.
 In stats, they ask things about populations. These are a collection of individuals or objects that you are interested in. 
 Sometimes you cannot obtain the population. 
 A sample is a subset of the population. N= population and n=sample. 
 finite population stats: use a smaller sample to represent a larger population. 
 A good sample should look just like the population. 
 Two types of stats; descriptive vs inferential. Descriptive= summarizing something and inferential= infering or predict  Inferential; used to predict. Use the data we have to predict data we don't have. 
 ","Descriptive stats: graphing, describing, and characterizing data. 
 Tells us something about the sample. 
 Inferential stats; tells us something about the population 
 Random Sampling is equally likely to be picked. This means everyone can be picked; equally. 
 Collecting data... experiment vs. direct observation. 
 The experiment is important to know how to design them. 
 Direct observation; the simplest kind is a survey. cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective studies. 
 Cross-sectional is when you take a measurement at a time and compare the data. 
 Retrospective studies go back in time. 
 Prospective studies go forward in time. they are logitd
  ud Prospective studies normally are done by people who collected ","Observational studies don't affect the action, they just observe.  You collect data as you observe but you can be in trouble if you forget vari
  Confounding variab Confounding variables: something that may contribute to y that is not x. 

You can't show cause and effect in observational studies. Hidden variables that affect your results.

Think... cause or related to. Which do you want? 

SRS is simple random sampling Which is everyone has an equal chance to be picked.

Convenience sampling is choosing a sample based on ease of access. It is convenient 

Stratified sampling is splitting the population into smaller group and randomly sample from each. 



Your sample needs to be unbiased  Generalization is needed an unbiased sample to represent and make predictions about the population. 

Selection bias is the selected subset that doesn't represent the whole population. 

Nonresponse bias 

Response bias when you don't word your question in a neutral way. this makes data invalid.

Do not migrate. don't fly well due to large beaks-unbalance. hop from branch to branch. biger toucan have bigger bills. toucans have 4 toes, 1st and 4 turned backwards. grab onto branches to stand for long time. Find natural treeholes or ones from woodpeckers to rais family. Sleeping: bill rests on back and fold tail upwards to compact their body. back 3 vertebrae ar efusedParent toucans share incubation. Take turns sitting on eggs. They are very impatient and venture outside leaving eggs unattended often. babies hatch blind and naked. both parents have feeding duties. Start flying around 7 weeks. Family stays together and travel in groups (usually in 20 plus). Playful birds and spar with bills.","have conspicuous feathers. black with color contrast somewhere on body. Toco has white on throat and chest. Keel-billed has yellow. No feathes on bill, feet and eyes. Area around eyes is colorful skin. Color is for survival function disguised as fruit in tree. Need blood sample for DNA test to determine gender. Bill size is related to body. Bill can bebill can be more than half the size of body. Bill structure is honeycomb like. Made of kerotin: protein compound. Consistency of a hard sponge. Contain thin outer sheath over hollow area. creates balanced strength to weight ratio. Have serated edges. May have eating fish in past, but now eat fruit. Long grey tongues. Useful for foraging and communication. Can help defend against predators. Sit in crown of tree and reach to fruits to avoid week branches. Grab fruit with bill and then toss it into their throat by throwing head back. Long digestion period of fruit. Cant eat while they digest. Bill pattern helps them recognize eachother and mate. Tucans can manage body temp by sending blood flow to their bill. Not covered in feat","Owning a toucan. before 1992 they were exported from central and south America. deforestation is reason for drop in wild bird population. Those that dont become pets are put in pet shops and not treated well. fed dog food. breeders didn't know how to care for toucans and neither did future owners. many people attracted to toucans because of how they looked. US had largest demand. not cheap. had to buy fresh fruit and special low iron pellets. Cost more than fish or guinea pig. Are very picky eaters and will not eat canned or frozen fruit. Toys to keep them entertained but only last a few months because they play rough or are not interested at all. They require space. Unlike parrot. They are full of energy. Decrease in population and rare in American aviculture. fewer than 10 facilities that breed in US. $500 dollars back in day and now cost $10000. Supply and demand has changed. Parrots took over as prefered bird pet of choice bc they were easier to take care of.

Some birds died when they laid sideways. can take liver biopsy from healthy toucan and looking for iron deposit. sometimes xray can show if liver is enlarged, but cannot diagnose hemochromatosis - this also causes heart enlargement. Hemochromatosis causes extreme damage to liver and heart. Phlebotomy for treatment. releases excess iron from blood. So excess iron in liver is used to create new blood.
